# Personal-Portfolio
I specialize in both front-end and back-end development using technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and Python. On the back end, I build robust APIs and handle data with SQL and NoSQL databases. I also have experience in containerization with Docker and cloud services like AWS.
